# Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is used to understand the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic regression equation. 

- It can help you predict the likelihood of an event happening or a choice being made.

- The dependent variable should be binary like yes or no.



**Linear Regression** outputs *continuous* value, and it has a straight line to map the input variables to the dependent variables. The output can be any of an infinite number of possibilities. 

**Logistic Regression** uses a logistic function to map the input variables to *categorical* response/dependent variables. In contrast to Linear Regression, Logistic Regression outputs a probability between 0 and 1.
